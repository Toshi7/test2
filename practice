What is HTML ?
------------------------------

> HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[1] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
>
> [HyperText Markup Language - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)

「markup language is to show **structure of the document**」

Therefore

「HTML is to show **structure of Web pages using markup**」

related reference:

- [Hypertext - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)

    > Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text which the reader can immediately access, or where text can be revealed progressively at multiple levels of detail (also called StretchText).

- [Markup language - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)
- [Lightweight markup language - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language)
    - [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) are also markup language.

Anyways, let's touch a HTML
------------------------------

### Creating HTML file

1. create text file on your Desktop
1. change the name of text file that you just created to index.html
1. edit index.html with note pad
1. Copy [HTML文書の例](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperText_Markup_Language#HTML.E6.96.87.E6.9B.B8) to index.html
1. Save your text file and close it.
1. Double click the index.html and run the browser.

※change the encoding if contents in index.html are unreadable characters

### Displaying on screen

1. Open website in any browser
1. right click on browser → check the page source

please check the structure of website you are opening 

Next, let's read the HTML code
------------------------------

Take a look at [HTML文書の例](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperText_Markup_Language#HTML.E6.96.87.E6.9B.B8) 

![](images/html_what_tag.png)

- Everything is surrounded by html tags`<>`？
- Various things are written in`<>`？
- Something is surrounded by `<>` and `<>`？

There are to configure **Element(Tag)**

### What is the Element of HTML？

It is to express the HTML structure

Typical HTML elements:

- `a`: Defines a hyperlink
- `title`: Defines a title for the document
- `strong`: Defines important text

When you write HTML Element, you can see the marks called called **Tag**


### What is Tag？

Name of Elements is surrounded by angle bracket（ `<` and `>` ）


### This is how HTML elements creates

For example, if you access a link of GitHub,


```html
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
```

You need to put `a` Elements(Tags) like above.
Lets break this down


![](./images/html_element_tag.png)

- opening and closing tags
  - It is written by `<Element name>` and `</Element name>`
- Element Content
  - another HTML element (the <body> element)
- Attribute
  - Attributes provide additional information about an element
  - Example of what the difference between Element Content and Attribute: `<a href="http://example.com">bar</a>`
    - The word of `bar` **expresses** the link to another page websites
      - showing the **structure(What)** which corresponds to contents
    - The word of `bar` is pasted to link of `http://example.com`
      - adding **information(Where)** which corresponds to contents

If you want to know more about what other tags and attribute have, search them by using the websites or books

Reference:

- [HTML elements - HTML5](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp)
- [HTML Tag Reference）](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_tags_reference.htm)
- [\<A>－HTMLHTML Tag Reference](http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/myfirstsite/tagreference.html)

### The things you should check below when you write the elements.

1. There are some tags which can be used and deprecated and also cannot be used depends on what kind of browser and which versions.
1. The way to show is sometimes difference depends on what kind of browsers and versions.
1. There is no distinction between capital letters and small letters for elements name
1. Attribute value is surrounded by **quotes**, such as「`"foo"`」 and 「`'foo'`」
   - × `<a href=http://example.com>`
   - ○ `<a href="http://example.com">`
1. later discussion **Entity Reference**

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or W3). Group of [W3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) that gives advice(open specification)

[HTML 4.0 Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40-971218/)

### Character Entity Reference
For exmaple,
    I really want to eat <pizza> !!

We are thinknig about making these sentences emphasize.
To write as HTML, 

```
<strong>I really want to eat <pizza>!!</strong>
```

what's going to happen if you display this on browser?

![](images/html_entity_reference.png)

We don't know what to eat by looking at this.

The reason why this happens is because browser interprets HTML simply by following these 5 things below. 

1. HTML is structured by Elements
2. Tags are written for Elements
3. Tags are written by `<` `>`
4. Consequently, if `<` and `>` are used, HTML thinks「These are tags right？」
5. Do not display directly the tags on browser

As a result, it didn't recognize `<pizza>` as **Element Content**. It recognized it as **opening tags**

It is necessary to write the contents of writing style if you want to display `<` or `>`  which is ** marks of elements to show** for HTML

| marks | writing style        |
|------|-----------------|
| `<`  | `&lt;`          |
| `>`  | `&gt;`          |
| `"`  | `&quot;`        |
| `&`  | `&amp;`         |

So, 

```
<strong>I really want to eat &lt;pizza&gt; !!</strong>
```

This is the right answer.

overall structure of HTML
------------------------------

### basic structure

```html
<html>
    <head>
        Header
    </head>
    <body>
        body
    </body>
</html>
```

| Elements       | Explanation                                                                        |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| html       | HTML tag declares HTML is used in the document. It is needed to write it at the beginning and end of the sentences. |
| head       | The HEAD element contains information about the current document, such as its title.                                    |
| body       | The BODY element contains information about the document's content which displays on browser.                           |

### Tree structure

a structure in which there are successive branchings or subdivisions.

If we want to display HTML Element Tree based on [HTML文書の例](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperText_Markup_Language#HTML.E6.96.87.E6.9B.B8), we will get that below.

![](images/html_tree.png)

You need to look up what the CSS and JavaScript briefly since we often use these which have relationship of elements

Exercise 1 - Let's use various kinds of elements 
------------------------------

### Save the source code below into a file

* Character encoding： UTF-8
* File extension　　： html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ja">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

### write sentence in between `<body>` and `</body>`

```html
<body>
    My first HTML
</body>
```

### Write the comments

Format： `<!-- comment text -->`

```html
<body>
    <!-- This is html comment -->
    My first HTML
</body>
```

### Put the Head

Format： `<h1>Head</h1>`

abbreviation of heading

```html
<body>
    <!--This is html comment -->
    <h1>My first HTML</h1>
</body>
```

### Making the Paragraphs

Format： `<p>sentence in paragrah・・・・</p>`

Abbreviation of paragraph

```html
<body>
    <!-- This is html comment  -->
    <h1>My first HTML</h1>

    <p>This lecture is for people who want to develop the website 
       This lecture will give you simple explanation about how to write HTML and style sheets to develope the websites </p>
</body>
```

### New Line

Format： `<br>`

abbreviation of break

```html
<body>
    <!-- This is html comment -->
    <h1>My first HTML</h1>

    <p>This lecture is for people who want to develop the website <br>
       This lecture will give you simple explanation about how to write HTML and style sheets to develope the websites</p>
</body>
```

### Pasting the links

Format： `<a href="destination address of the link">link text</a>`

※abbreviation of Anchor

```html
<body>
    <a href="http://www.yahoo.co.jp">Yahoo</a>
    <a href="http://www.google.co.jp">Google</a>
    <a href="mailto: hoge@example.com">Inquiry</a>
</body>
```

### display the special character

Format： `&lt;`  `&gt;`  `&quot;`  `&amp;`

```html
<body>
    <p>Use &lt; and p&gt; for paragraph</p>
    I like &quot;Ａ &amp; Ｗ&quot;.<br>
</body>
```

### Try the other tags by reference to the websites of HTML tags.

[HTML Tag Reference](http://www.mytoptutorials.com/html/html-tags-reference/)

Form
------------------------------

As we mentioned HTML at the beginning,

> Hypertext is the a software system allowing extensive cross-referencing between related sections of text and associated graphic material.


It has the structure to link to multiple documents(web pages if it is HTML) 

Other than `<a>` and `<link>` we introduced before, 
there is another way to link to a web page by using **Form** 

Exmaple of form description:

Save the source code below into a file

* Character encoding： UTF-8
* File extension　　： html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head><meta charset=UTF-8></head>
    <body>
        <form action="index.html" method="GET">
            <h1>Registration screen for HTML lecture</h1>
            Name: <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br>
            Gender: <select name="gender">
                      <option></option>
                      <option value="0">Male</option>
                      <option value="1">Female</option>
                  </select><br>
            E-Mail: <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br>
            <input type="submit" value="send"><input type="submit" value="back">
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

- `<form>`'s `action` attribute
  - destination of form data
  - It is like `href` attribute of `<a>`
- `<form>`'s `method` attribute
  - To decide how to access destination of form data,  we need to specify (HTTP method: transfer method). 
- `<input>`, `<select>`, and so on. 
  - It is called **form control elements**

by using form, not only screen transition to destination of form data but also you can pass the parameter together at the same time.

Example:

- on your Facebook login page, enter your login ID and password and send them to authentication page. 
- Run a Google search

For further details, we will cover in lecture for HTTP/Web application development.

Exercise 2 - HTML Summary
------------------------------

Create 1 page by using elements which are not covered here in this HTML lecture


- Table `table`

    These are examples of table below

    | Menu                           | Price (Size M) | Price (Size L) |
    |------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
    | Quattro Formaggi              | 2,450 yen   | 3,800 yen  |
    | Premium・Cheese Roll Quattro | 2,800 yen   | 3,970 yen  |
    | Domino・Deluxe                | 2,000 yen   | 3,000 yen  |

- HTML Lists `ul` and `li`

    These are examples of Lists(`ul` and `li`) below

    1. Beginning
    2. Self Introduction
    3. Editorial
        1. The day I left
        2. Meeting that person
    4. End

- challenging! 
    - chalenge to make your websites look good using CSS if you already know the knowledge of CSS.

- Other things that you need to care about
    * Are you using HTML tag correctly ?
    * Are your attribution and content of elements ?
    * Did you align the indentation ?

Finish!
------------------------------

 Thanks for your hard work!
